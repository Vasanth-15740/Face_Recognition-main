It allows users to register their faces, detect and recognize faces from live webcam feed, manage attendance records, and perform various other tasks.

## Usage

   - Click on the `Add a new face` button.
   - Enter your name in the small window that pops up and press `OK`.
   - A camera window will appear in 3 seconds, capturing your face.
   - After capturing the image, press any key, and it will be stored in the `ImagesAttendance` folder.

2. **Detect and Recognize Faces:**
   - Use the `Scan Face (Webcam)` button to detect and recognize faces from the live webcam feed.
   - Ensure that only your face is visible in the images stored in the `ImagesAttendance` folder for better recognition performance.

3. **Manage Images:**
   - The `Show Scanned Images` folder contains images recognized by the program.
   - Use the `Delete a face` button to delete images. You can select multiple images for deletion.
